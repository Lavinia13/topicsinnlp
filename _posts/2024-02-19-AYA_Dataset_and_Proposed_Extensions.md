An exploratory analysis of AYA Dataset and Collection, with proposed extension recipes to improve task diversity for mid and low-popularity languages.


## AYA Dataset and Collection

The AYA project was initiated and coordinated by Cohere and Cohere for AI. The release includes a multilingual dataset and a larger data collection, allowing for the progress of AI to cover a more global audience.

The overall distribution of entries per language in the AYA dataset is displayed in the plot below. We observe a skew towards Asian languages. Some of the high and medium represented languages in terms of overall text availability online (such as French, German, Romanian, Dutch etc as per the tables in the AYA paper) are underrepresented or missing completely from this first version of the dataset.
